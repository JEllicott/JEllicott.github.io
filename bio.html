        <div class="bio">
                I paint medium large oil paintings of contemporary dance and make fluid exploratory drawings.
                I want the paintings to have a beguiling presence in a room, to make you look and immerse yourself again and again.
                I believe there is still mileage in the De Kooning legacy of expressive figuration and the centuries old craft of paint and canvas.
                This is how I respond to my passion for the mesmerising art form of dance. Swathes of juicy paint echo the muscular actions of the dancers
                and my own turbulent response but are held in check by a tautly composed rectangular canvas and hopefully arrive at a place of poetic
                equilibrium.
